0.1.0
    * Minimal updates for Django 2 support.

0.0.8
    * The importer class can now be used as a mixin.
    * Fixes for the truncation of values in related objects on
      importing
    * The importer management command now uses the generic
      truncation option rather than specifying particular fields
      to truncate.
    * Make the behaviour of the importer when the 'identifiers'
      object is missing and [] consistent.
    * Add an option to the importer to preserve existing
      identifiers with particular schemes.
0.0.7
    * Raise an error on (rather than silenty ignore) inline
      areas without an 'id' attribute in the importer.
    * Fix the import of areas with parents.
    * Don't error if a source or link is missing 'note'.
0.0.6
    * Many improvements to the code that imports from Popolo JSON
    * Fix the migrations for Python 2 (@wfdd)
0.0.5
    * Sync with upstream (at 3a34d5cb, plus PR #28).
0.0.2
    * Python 3 compatibility changes (James McKinney).
0.0.1
    * Initial release of fork on PyPI. The only difference with upstream is the
      removal of slugs and autoslug, so something using this app can decide how
      it handles them.
